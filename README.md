# hello-world
My first hello world
This is my 1st git-hub project. I am a begginer in  programing world, my goal is to become back-end developer.
Currently my interests are PHP and laravel. My basic knowlidge of html 5, ccs 3 and bootstrap are just making things more cool.
Also I designed some projects (webinars) in Adobe captivate.
I hope that's good for now.
